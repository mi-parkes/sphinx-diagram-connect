   :status: implemented
   :type_ext: Functional
   :reasoning: Direct support for core Sphinx linking.
   :test: tsc_int_00001
   :acceptance: Resolved Sphinx references generate valid URIs.
   :satisfy: ftr_demo_00002

   The system shall resolve standard Sphinx cross-references (e.g., `:ref:`target``, `:doc:`target``) found in `xlink:href` attributes to their corresponding relative or absolute HTML URIs within the Sphinx build output.

.. req:: Sphinx-Needs Reference Resolution
   :id: req_demo_00003
   :status: implemented
   :type_ext: Functional
   :reasoning: Integration with Sphinx-Needs for traceability.
   :test: tsc_int_00003
   :acceptance: Resolved Sphinx-Needs references generate valid URIs.
   :satisfy: ftr_demo_00003

   The system shall resolve Sphinx-Needs references (e.g., `:need:`MY_NEED_ID``) found in `xlink:href` attributes to their corresponding HTML URIs based on the `needs.json` output, if `needs_build_json` is enabled.

.. req:: SVG File Modification
   :id: req_demo_00004
   :status: implemented
   :type_ext: Functional
   :reasoning: Essential for making links clickable.
   :test: tsc_int_00001, tsc_int_00003
   :acceptance: Modified SVG files contain the correct, updated `xlink:href` values.
   :satisfy: ftr_demo_00001

   The system shall modify the `xlink:href` attributes within the SVG files by replacing the original Sphinx or Sphinx-Needs reference patterns with the resolved URIs.

.. req:: SVG Output Preservation
   :id: req_demo_00005
   :status: implemented
   :type_ext: Functional
   :reasoning: Ensures valid SVG output.
   :test: tsc_int_00001
   :acceptance: The written SVG files are well-formed and display correctly.
   :satisfy: ftr_demo_00001

   The system shall write the modified SVG content back to the original file path, ensuring the output remains a valid and well-formed SVG.

Nonfunctional Requirements
---------------------------
.. needtable::
   :columns: id,title,status,refinement,satisfy,test
   :types: req
   :filter: "type_ext == 'Nonfunctional'"

.. needflow::
   :types: req
   :filter: "type_ext == 'Nonfunctional'"

.. req:: Build Process Compatibility
   :id: req_demo_00006
   :status: implemented
   :type_ext: Nonfunctional
   :reasoning: Ensures smooth integration into Sphinx.
   :test: tsc_int_00001
   :acceptance: The extension integrates without causing Sphinx build failures.
   :satisfy: ftr_demo_00001

   The extension shall seamlessly integrate into the standard Sphinx build process and execute its logic during the `build-finished` event without introducing errors that halt the build.

.. req:: Performance Efficiency
   :id: req_demo_00007
   :status: open
   :type_ext: Nonfunctional
   :reasoning: Important for large documentation sets.
   :test:
   :acceptance: Processing time for SVGs is minimal, not significantly impacting build times.
   :refinement: req_demo_00008
   :satisfy: ftr_demo_00001

   The SVG parsing and modification process shall be optimized to ensure minimal impact on the overall Sphinx build time, particularly for projects with a large number of SVG diagrams.

.. req:: Scalability for Multiple SVGs
   :id: req_demo_00008
   :status: open
   :type_ext: Nonfunctional
   :reasoning: Ensures performance with many diagrams.
   :test:
   :acceptance: The extension handles 100+ SVG files without excessive memory or time consumption.
   :satisfy: ftr_demo_00001

   The system shall efficiently handle the processing of a large number of SVG files (e.g., hundreds or thousands) within a single Sphinx build, without encountering memory exhaustion or excessively long processing times.

.. req:: Informative Logging
   :id: req_demo_00009
   :status: implemented
   :type_ext: Nonfunctional
   :reasoning: Aids debugging and user understanding.
   :test: tsc_int_00002, tsc_int_00004
   :acceptance: Log messages are clear and accurate.
   :refinement: req_demo_00010
   :satisfy: ftr_demo_00004, ftr_demo_00005

   The system shall provide clear and informative log messages for successful reference resolutions and warnings for unresolved references, to aid users in understanding the extension's operations and troubleshooting.

.. req:: Configurable Verbosity Level
   :id: req_demo_00010
   :status: implemented
   :type_ext: Nonfunctional
   :reasoning: User control over logging detail.
   :test: tsc_int_00004
   :acceptance: Verbose logging can be toggled via `conf.py`.
   :satisfy: ftr_demo_00004

   The system shall allow users to configure the verbosity level of the extension's logging output via a Sphinx configuration option in `conf.py`.
