spc
###

**spc** (Specification):

The ``spc`` directive describes detailed design-level behaviors and implementation specifications derived from system requirements. Specifications bridge the gap between what the system must do (requirements) and how it will be done (design and code).

.. code-block:: rst

    .. spc:: TITLE
       :id: spc_demo_00001
       :status: open
       :refinement: spc_demo_00002, spc_demo_00003
       :satisfy: req_demo_00001, req_demo_00002

       CONTENT_BODY

**Field Descriptions:**

- ``:id:``  
  Unique identifier for the specification.  
  Must match the pattern: ``spc_demo_[0-9]{5,5}``.

- ``:status:``  
  Current status (e.g., ``open``, ``draft``, ``approved``).

- ``:refinement:``  
  (Optional) A comma-separated list of other ``spc`` IDs that refine this specification.

- ``:satisfy:``  
  A list of one or more ``req`` IDs this specification fulfills.

- ``CONTENT_BODY``  
  A comprehensive description of the design behavior, structural constraints, component interactions, or algorithmic logic that implements one or more requirements.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: rst

    .. spc:: Diagram Export Mechanism
       :id: spc_demo_00001
       :status: open
       :refinement:
       :satisfy: req_demo_00001

       The system must include a server-side renderer module capable of converting PlantUML text into PNG images using the PlantUML Java library.
